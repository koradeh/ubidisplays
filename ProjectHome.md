**This tool makes building interactive projected displays quick and easy!**

_This is UbiDisplays, a prototype toolkit for building interactive displays using a projector and a Microsoft Kinect._  The software is still in beta and so please report bugs on the issues page. We will resolve them as soon as possible.

The tool enables you to drag and drop interactive web content into the world around you. You can use it to prototype new kinds computer interfaces for interior designs and furniture.  Think of it as _a programming environment for physical spaces_.

Using a Javascript API, displays are able to move around, appear and disappear.  This helps them to blend into the physical aesthetic of a space or installation. Displays can also choose their own interaction method: multi-touch, single touch, foot detection, coffee-mug detector or you can write more.

In the past, similar systems required a lot of time and skill to build.  As a result, it has been difficult for them leave research labs and make it out into the hands of people who want to apply and innovate with them in their own way.  The aim of this toolkit is to make building an interactive projected display as simple as building a web page.  By allowing more people to try it out and experiment with new ways of interacting with buildings, furniture and appliances, we will hopefully learn about how to design better interfaces for the future.
